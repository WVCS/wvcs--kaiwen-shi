    <h2> All About Me </h2>
    <h3> I am Kaiwen. I am currently a junior at Westview and will be going on into senior year. In my free time, I love watching baseball and my favorite team is the San Diego Padres obviously, because I was raised in San Diego. I also like going to the beach and riding bikes. I love learning about other cultures because they're really interesting and I find many traditions fascinating. I think we all definitely need to be more culturally aware of other people because we live in a very diverse area with many ethnicities, languages spoken, and cultured celebrated. I also love political science and history and hope to major in one of those two.
