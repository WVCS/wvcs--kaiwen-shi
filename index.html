 <h2> Welcome to my page </h2>
    
    <h3> Hello there, I am Kaiwen and I am a junior and I am almost about to be a senior at Westview. As you may know, I love learning computer science because it is very interesting, but I love history and politics more because one day, I would love to major in one of those two. In my spare time, I love watching baseball. I of course support the San Diego Padres 100% because I live in San Diego and grew up here my entire life. I also love going to the beach and riding my bike. Biking is a very fun activity and it gives me my exercise for the day. I also love trying new foods and learning about different cultures because all cultures are fascinating, especially when you live in the United States, which is a diverse country, a melting pot of many different cultures and ethnicities with over 300 different languages being spoken.
